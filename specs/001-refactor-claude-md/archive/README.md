# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documents that were used as input to create the specification but should NOT be used to guide planning or implementation.

## Contents

- `original-analysis-input.md` - Pre-specification analysis with implementation ideas (archived for reference only)

## Purpose

Documents here are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding the original thinking
- Post-implementation review

## Important

**Do not use archived documents for planning.** The planning phase should work exclusively from `../spec.md` to ensure proper requirements-driven design without implementation bias.
