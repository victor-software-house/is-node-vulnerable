This directory contains historical analysis files from the planning and correction phase.

## Files

- **issues.md**: Original issue tracking document identifying 5 critical specification problems

- **remediation-plan.md**: Remediation recommendations from speckit.analyze final review

## Context

These files document the specification refinement process:
1. Initial implementation attempt revealed issues (issues.md)
2. Paused implementation to research official documentation
3. Performed comprehensive analysis (issues-analysis.md)
4. Applied corrections to all specification files (corrections-summary.md)
5. Final validation with speckit.analyze (remediation-plan.md)

All corrections have been applied to core specification files. This archive preserves the analysis trail for reference.

**Status**: Historical - not required for implementation execution
